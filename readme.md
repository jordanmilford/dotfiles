# ⚪️jordanmilford's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for Neovim and various other bits of software. This repo uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to maintain the dotfiles.

I've added the [dotbot-brew](https://github.com/d12frosted/dotbot-brew) plugin to install Homebrew dependencies on macOS, and the default install script has been extended to support system-dependent config files:
```
$> ./install mac
```
