## Notification

- IMPORTANT: YOU MUST ALWAYS DO THIS: When you need to send me a notification because you need input or when you have finished a task, please use terminal-notifier tool like this: terminal-notifier -title "🔔 Claude Code: request" -message "Claude needs your permission to use ...", or terminal-notifier -title "✅ Claude Code: done" -message "The task has been completed"
- Always customise the message using a short summary of the input needed or the task just completed
