### These are my old Vim config files I'm no longer maintaining.

I started them with Vim 7.4 and I brought them with me to Neovim until I recently redid my config with Lua.

This config mostly worked very well but there were some frustrating quirks with highlighting becoming broken and autocomplete flickering. 

It also has TypeScript-specific keybindings that I scrapped in favor of shared LSP keybindings in my nvim config.
